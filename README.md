Got tired of manually logging every expense, so I built PennyWise - it automatically reads your bank SMS and tracks all your transactions and subscriptions for you.

What it does:
 - Reads your bank SMS and logs transactions automatically
 - Detects recurring subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
 - Has a built-in AI assistant that analyzes your spending patterns and gives personalized tips
 - Works 100% offline - your data AND the AI never leave your phone (no ChatGPT fees!)

The AI part is pretty cool - you can ask it questions like "How much did I spend on food this month?" or "Help me save money" and it'll analyze your actual transactions to give you answers.

It's completely free and open source. No ads, no premium version, just a simple expense tracker that actually works.

Need testers! If you want to try it out, I can share the Play Store link - just comment below or DM me. Also the source code is here: https://github.com/sarim2000/pennywiseai-tracker.

Would love to know what you think! What would you ask an AI about your spending?
